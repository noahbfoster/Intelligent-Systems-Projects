.py file:
The included .py file must be run with python 3.
Run it using python3 if you want the version of the program that supports user input, though the .ipynb file also includes the user code as a cell.

.ipynb file:
The included .ipynb file was mainly used for ease of development, but it also includes the Input/Output cases as summarized in the Report document. 
It can be opened using Jupyter Notebook or another .ipynb file editor. It must also be run using Python 3, but that should be default for the notebook.
