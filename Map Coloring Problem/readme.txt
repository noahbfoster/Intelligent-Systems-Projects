.py file:
The included .py file must be run with python 3.
Run it using Python3. I would suggest using the .ipynb file version instead since it is more user friendly.

.ipynb file (Suggested):
The included .ipynb file was used for development.
It can be opened using Jupyter Notebook or another .ipynb file editor. It must also be run using Python 3, but that should be default for the notebook.
