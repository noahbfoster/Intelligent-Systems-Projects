.py file:
The included .py file must be run with python 3.
Run it using Python3. I would suggest using the .ipynb file version instead since it is more user friendly.

.ipynb file (Suggested):
The included .ipynb file was used for development and includes all the required User input code in one block. 
It can be opened using Jupyter Notebook or another .ipynb file editor. It must also be run using Python 3, but that should be default for the notebook.
The last cell is the same as the second to last, but does not include the 4 random initial configuration code, so you can more clearly see the results for the other parts.

Thank you for your time, please let me know if I am missing anything by emailing me at nfoster8@uncc.edu
